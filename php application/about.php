         <p class="py-3">New Zealand is a sovereign island country in the southwestern Pacific Ocean.
            The country has two main landmasses—the North Island, and the South Island—and around 600 
            smaller islands. It has a total land area of 268,000 square kilometres (103,500 sq mi). 
            New Zealand is about 2,000 kilometres (1,200 mi) east of Australia across the Tasman Sea
             and 1,000 kilometres (600 mi) south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, 
             and Tonga. 
             A developed country, New Zealand ranks highly in international comparisons of national
              performance, such as quality of life, health, education, protection of civil liberties, and 
              economic freedom. New Zealand underwent major economic changes during the 1980s, which
               transformed it from a protectionist to a liberalised free-trade economy. The service sector
                dominates the national economy, followed by the industrial sector, and agriculture;international tourism is a significant source of revenue. Nationally, legislative authority is vested in an elected, unicameral Parliament, while executive political power is exercised
                   by the Cabinet, led by the prime minister, currently Jacinda Ardern. Queen Elizabeth II is
 the country's monarch and is represented by a governor-general, currently Dame Patsy Reddy. In addition,
  New Zealand is organised into 11 regional councils and 67 territorial authorities for local government 
  purposes. The Realm of New Zealand also includes Tokelau (a dependent territory); the Cook Islands
   and Niue (self-governing states in free association with New Zealand); and the Ross Dependency,
    which is New Zealand's territorial claim in Antarctica.
