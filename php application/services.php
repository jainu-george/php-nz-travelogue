All New Zealand cities and most towns have buses, and Auckland and Wellington both
         have city-suburban rail services.You will see that peak hour services are generally good. But New 
         Zealand is a land of wide open spaces and low population density. This makes it impractical to
          provide the extensive public transport systems you find in more built-up and crowded cities.
That is why so many of us find a car essential. Some Kiwis would also say we like driving because it reflects 
our independent streak. The NZTA has produced a must-read booklet about driving in New Zealand.
         It explains everything you need to know about staying safe and obeying New Zealand’s driving laws.
Translations are available in Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Samoan, Tongan, Tuvaluan, Spanish, Portuguese,
 French, German, Thai and Arabic.
Remember, keep to the left of the road when you are driving a car in New Zealand. When you are parking a car, 
make sure it is facing the direction of the traffic and do not park over a driveway, even your own.
Full New Zealand driving rules are in the New Zealand Road Code.</p><br>

    Luckily, H&S is not something you have to do alone. Everyone at your work has 
        a role to play in watching each other’s back, identifying and managing risks, and ensuring a healthy, 
        safe and incident-free work environment. H&S plans don’t necessarily require lots of paperwork
         or expensive equipment. Apart from obvious benefits such as worker well-being, it also helps:<br>

increase productivity<br>
reduce worker absenteeism<br>
give your business a strong image<br>
bring peace of mind to workers and owners<br>
fulfil your legal responsibilities<br>
open the door to tender opportunities and winning new work<br>
keep customers happy.</p>
